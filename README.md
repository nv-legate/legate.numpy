[![Build Nightly release package](https://github.com/nv-legate/cupynumeric.internal/actions/workflows/ci-gh-nightly-release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nv-legate/cupynumeric.internal/actions/workflows/ci-gh-nightly-release.yml)

# cuPyNumeric

cuPyNumeric is a [Legate](https://github.com/nv-legate/legate.core) library
that aims to provide a distributed and accelerated drop-in replacement for the
[NumPy API](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/) on top of the
[Legion](https://legion.stanford.edu) runtime. Using cuPyNumeric you can do things like run
[the final example of the Python CFD course](https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython/blob/master/lessons/15_Step_12.ipynb)
completely unmodified on 2048 A100 GPUs in a
[DGX SuperPOD](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-superpod/)
and achieve good weak scaling.

cuPyNumeric works best for programs that have very large arrays of data
that cannot fit in the memory of a single GPU or a single node and need
to span multiple nodes and GPUs. While our implementation of the current
NumPy API is still incomplete, programs that use unimplemented features
will still work (assuming enough memory) by falling back to the
canonical NumPy implementation.

## Installation

cuPyNumeric is available from [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html)
on the [legate channel](https://anaconda.org/legate/cupynumeric).
See https://docs.nvidia.com/cupynumeric/latest/installation.html for
details about different install configurations, or building
cuPyNumeric from source.

## Documentation
