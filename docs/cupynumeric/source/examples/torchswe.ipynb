    "[TorchSWE](https://github.com/piyueh/TorchSWE) is a shallow-water solver created by Dr. Pi-Yueh Chuang and Prof. Lorena Barba that solves the vertically averaged Navier-Stokes equations using MPI and CuPy. It can simulate free-surface water flow in rivers, channels, and coastal areas, as well as model flood inundation. Given a topography, TorchSWE can predict flood-prone areas and the height of water inundation, making it a valuable tool for risk mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "High-resolution numerical simulations—such as those on real topographies requiring hundreds of millions of data points—demand distributed computation across multiple GPUs. Although scalability is achievable with MPI4Py and CuPy, this approach requires manually partitioning the problem and managing inter-GPU data communication, which are complex and error-prone tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "cuPyNumeric enables a distributed implementation of TorchSWE using only NumPy operations, without the complexities of MPI+CuPy. After porting TorchSWE to cuPyNumeric by removing all domain decomposition logic, it scaled effortlessly across multiple GPUs and nodes without further code modifications. This scalability enabled high-fidelity simulations exceeding 1.2 billion data points using 32 GPUs, allowing researchers to tackle critical scientific problems in flood inundation modeling without needing specialized distributed computing expertise. Overall, the cuPyNumeric implementation reduced the lines of code by over 20%, and simplified development and maintenance by eliminating complex logic for managing distribution and communication.\n"

    "This example follows TorchSWE's approach to domain decomposition and parallelization as in the original implementation. It starts with MPI initialization and sets up logic to manage GPU assignment per rank, dividing the global grid into subdomains. Each rank is responsible for a local subgrid with added halo rows to hold neighboring data. Once the domain is decomposed, the user must ensure proper communication of data at processor boundaries, accounting for datatype differences between CuPy and MPI4Py. For optimal performance, the appropriate type of point-to-point communication, such as non-blocking send/recv, must be selected, as incorrect implementation can cause deadlock. Users must also handle varying numbers of neighboring ranks on domain boundaries and ensure data exchange across mesh, topography, and solution variables. Non-blocking `Isend` and `Irecv` functions handle boundary data exchanges, allowing each rank to receive necessary data for stencil computations. After a `Waitall` synchronization step, each rank performs computations on its subdomain. Finally, custom MPI data types are freed, and `MPI_Finalize()` concludes the environment.\n",
